# Patient Gateway API

This project provides an API for managing patient data. It allows you to fetch patient information from a MongoDB database based on optional parameters such as patient name and next appointment date.

## Features

- Fetch patient data by name
- Fetch patient data by next appointment date
- Fetch all patient data if no parameters are provided
- CORS enabled for all routes

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- MongoDB instance (local or remote)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/29deepanshutyagi/Patient.git
   cd Patient
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your MongoDB connection:**

   Update the MongoDB connection string in `app.py` if necessary. The current connection string is:

   ```python
   client = MongoClient("mongodb+srv://assesment_user:uYdY!7f9C-HnX%40Y@cluster0.vcxxyf3.mongodb.net/Formulo_assesment")
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the Flask application, execute:

```sh
python app.py
```

The application will start on http://localhost:5000.
